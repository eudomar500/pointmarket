# PredictionMarket Design

Design document for `contracts/PredictionMarket.py` (v1.0.4, 805 lines). Last updated May 17, 2026.

## Scope

A standalone Intelligent Contract that hosts binary prediction markets resolved against the Marketplace contract. Two market categories:

1. **Objective markets**: resolved by reading numeric metrics from the Marketplace (no LLM).
2. **Subjective markets**: resolved via LLM consensus reading structured Marketplace state for a single trade.

Both categories share pool mechanics, settlement timing, and reputation tracking. The contract reads the Marketplace at a fixed address held in storage; it does not modify Marketplace state. The link is one-directional: `PredictionMarket -> Marketplace`.

## Non-goals

- Markets over arbitrary external claims (off-chain events, crypto prices).
- AMM pricing (LMSR, CPMM). MVP uses parimutuel pool-share pricing.
- Permissionless market creation. MVP is admin-curated.
- Cross-chain markets, fiat settlement, oracle networks.

## Architecture

```
Marketplace.py (singleton, v1.4.4)
  +-- get_trade_summary(trade_id)              read by PredictionMarket
  +-- get_listing_details(trade_id)            read by PredictionMarket
  +-- get_volume_in_window(start, end)         read by PredictionMarket
  +-- get_dispute_rate_in_window_bps(s, e)     read by PredictionMarket
  +-- get_avg_price_in_window(start, end)      read by PredictionMarket
  +-- get_eligible_trade_count_in_window(...)  read by PredictionMarket
  +-- receive_fee()                            called by PredictionMarket (payable)
  +-- authorized_fee_sender                    set to PredictionMarket address
                  |
                  | cross-contract view + emit_transfer(value).receive_fee()
                  |
PredictionMarket.py (singleton, v1.0.1)
  +-- marketplace_address (Address, one-shot setable)
  +-- markets[market_id] (TreeMap)
  +-- bets[market_id][user] (nested TreeMap)
  +-- user_correct_predictions / user_total_predictions
  +-- Resolves objective markets locally via Marketplace views
  +-- Resolves subjective markets via gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe + LLM consensus

## Cross-contract interface

Per the [GenLayer interacting docs](https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/interacting-with-intelligent-contracts), the Marketplace is referenced via a typed `@gl.contract_interface`:

```python
@gl.contract_interface
class MarketplaceIface:
    class View:
        def get_metrics(self) -> dict: ...
        def get_eligible_trade_count_in_window(self, window_start: u64, window_end: u64) -> dict: ...
        def get_volume_in_window(self, window_start: u64, window_end: u64) -> dict: ...
        def get_dispute_rate_in_window_bps(self, window_start: u64, window_end: u64) -> dict: ...
        def get_avg_price_in_window(self, window_start: u64, window_end: u64) -> dict: ...
        def get_trade_summary(self, trade_id: u256) -> dict: ...
        def get_listing_details(self, trade_id: u256) -> dict: ...
    class Write:
        def receive_fee(self) -> None: ...
```

## Public API

### Admin write methods

| Method | Notes |
|---|---|
| `set_marketplace_address(addr: str)` | **One-shot.** Reverts if `marketplace_address != 0x00..00` or if `next_market_id != 0`. |
| `create_objective_market(question, metric_type, threshold, window_start, window_end, betting_close_at, settlement_at)` | Returns `market_id`. Validates `metric_type in [0,99]` and is in known set. |
| `create_subjective_market(question, metric_type, target_trade_id, betting_close_at, settlement_at)` | Returns `market_id`. Validates `metric_type in [100,199]` and is in known set. Calls `marketplace.view().get_trade_summary(target_trade_id)` to verify the trade exists. |
| `pause()` / `unpause()` | Halts `place_bet` and market creation. Reads, resolves, claims, and refunds remain available. |
| `transfer_admin(new_admin)` | One-step admin transfer. |
| `upgrade(new_code: bytes)` | Replaces the contract bytecode. Storage preserved. |

### Anyone write methods

| Method | Notes |
|---|---|
| `place_bet(market_id, predict_yes)` payable | Requires `state == OPEN`, `now < betting_close_at`, `value >= MIN_BET_WEI`. Increments `user_total_predictions[sender]` only on first bet for that market. |
| `resolve_market(market_id)` | Permissionless. Requires `now >= settlement_at`. Routes to `_resolve_objective` or `_resolve_subjective` by metric range. |
| `claim_winnings(market_id)` | Requires resolved state. Pays `user_winning * (total_pool - fee) / winning_pool`. Increments `user_correct_predictions` only if the bet was not hedged. |
| `refund_bet(market_id)` | Requires `state == REFUNDED`. Pays `yes_amount + no_amount`. Decrements `user_total_predictions` (refunded markets do not count against accuracy). |

### View methods

`get_market_summary(market_id)`, `get_user_bet(market_id, user)`, `get_user_reputation(user)`, `get_next_market_id()`, `get_marketplace_address()`, `get_contract_info()`, `is_paused()`, `is_admin(address)`.

## Settlement logic

### Objective resolution

`_resolve_objective` reads the appropriate Marketplace view depending on `metric_type`:

- `METRIC_TRADE_COUNT` -> `get_eligible_trade_count_in_window(window_start, window_end)`
- `METRIC_VOLUME_WEI` -> `get_volume_in_window(...)`
- `METRIC_DISPUTE_RATE_BPS` -> `get_dispute_rate_in_window_bps(...)`
- `METRIC_AVG_PRICE_WEI` -> `get_avg_price_in_window(...)`

For every metric:
1. If the returned dict has `truncated == true`, the market is refunded (we cannot trust a metric where the underlying iteration capped out). See Bug 4 fix below.
2. For `DISPUTE_RATE` and `AVG_PRICE`, if `total_count == 0` or `count == 0`, the market is refunded (the metric is undefined when there are no trades in the window).
3. Otherwise: `yes_wins = actual >= threshold` and resolution proceeds via `_finalize_resolution`.

### Subjective resolution

`_resolve_subjective` first fetches `get_trade_summary(target_trade_id)` to verify the trade is in a terminal state (`COMPLETED` or `REFUNDED`). If not, the market is refunded.

Then it dispatches by `metric_type`:

#### `METRIC_LLM_TRADE_DESCRIPTION_HONEST (100)`

Reads `get_listing_details(target_trade_id)`. Constructs a prompt that gives the LLM:
- The listing title and description
- Whether the trade was disputed
- The dispute LLM verdict and reasoning (if any)
- Whether the dispute was resolved by default judgment

The LLM is instructed to return one of `YES` / `NO` / `AMBIGUOUS` plus a short reasoning string. Buyer/seller listing text is treated as data, not as instructions (prompt injection defense).

#### `METRIC_LLM_SELLER_TRUSTWORTHY (101)`

Reads up to `MAX_SELLER_HISTORY_MATCHES = 30` trades involving the seller, scanning backward from `target_trade_id`. The scan is also capped at `MAX_TRADES_TO_SCAN = 200` to bound work even if the seller is sparse in the history (see Bug 3 fix below).

The LLM receives a compact summary of each historical trade (state, disputed, buyer won, resolved by default) and is asked to return `YES` / `NO` / `AMBIGUOUS`.

If no historical trades are found at all, the market is refunded.

### Consensus pattern

Both subjective metrics share the same wrapper `_run_llm_verdict` that builds a `leader_fn` / `validator_fn` pair and dispatches via `gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe`. The validator function re-executes the prompt and accepts the leader's verdict only if its own classification matches. This is the same pattern used by the Marketplace dispute resolver.

### Finalization

`_finalize_resolution(market_id, yes_wins)`:

1. If the winning side has an empty pool (no bettors voted that way), the market is refunded instead. See Bug 1 fix.
2. `fee = total_pool * MARKETPLACE_FEE_BPS / BPS_DENOMINATOR` (1%).
3. `state` set to `MARKET_RESOLVED_YES` or `MARKET_RESOLVED_NO`.
4. `fee_forwarded` stored on the market for accounting.
5. If `fee > 0`, the contract emits a cross-contract call:
   `marketplace.emit(value=fee, on='finalized').receive_fee()`.
   This is asynchronous and idempotent. Marketplace verifies that the sender is `authorized_fee_sender == PredictionMarket address`.

### Refund

`_refund_market(market_id, reason)` sets state to `MARKET_REFUNDED`, records the reason in `llm_resolution_reasoning`, and does NOT forward any fee. Users individually call `refund_bet` to recover their stake.

## Reputation

- **Track on first bet:** `user_total_predictions` increments when a user first bets in a given market (per-market, not per-bet).
- **Track on claim:** `user_correct_predictions` increments when `claim_winnings` succeeds on an un-hedged position.
- **Hedged positions:** if `yes_amount > 0 AND no_amount > 0`, the user is hedging; neither side counts as a correct prediction. The user still receives their proportional payout on the winning side.
- **Refunded markets:** `refund_bet` decrements `user_total_predictions`. Refunded markets do not penalize accuracy.

## Bugs fixed

A pre-deployment audit surfaced 7 substantive issues, fixed in v1.0.1. Two additional bugs were surfaced during end-to-end testing on Studionet and fixed in v1.0.2 and v1.0.3. All nine are documented below.

### Bug 1: Stuck funds when winning pool is empty

**Failure mode:** if the LLM resolves `YES` but nobody bet on YES, `claim_winnings` would still run but divide by `yes_pool == 0` (or, before this fix, divide-by-zero revert without refund path). Funds locked.

**Fix:** in `_finalize_resolution`:
```python
if yes_wins and market.yes_pool == u256(0):
    self._refund_market(market_id, "no bettors on winning side")
    return
if not yes_wins and market.no_pool == u256(0):
    self._refund_market(market_id, "no bettors on winning side")
    return
```

### Bug 2: Fee forwarding to Marketplace

**Concern:** is `marketplace.emit(value=fee, on='finalized').receive_fee()` the correct cross-contract value transfer pattern? Verified against the [official docs](https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/value-transfers). Pattern is correct.

**Defense:** `if fee > u256(0)` guard before the cross-contract call. Marketplace's `receive_fee()` itself reverts on `value == 0`, on unconfigured `authorized_fee_sender`, and on mismatched sender.

### Bug 3: Seller history scan DoS

**Failure mode:** `METRIC_LLM_SELLER_TRUSTWORTHY` scanned backward from `target_trade_id` looking for matches, with only a match-count cap. If the seller had 1 trade out of 1,000,000, the scan would iterate ~1M cross-contract view calls before terminating.

**Fix:** double cap: terminate scan when either condition is met first:
```python
while matches < MAX_SELLER_HISTORY_MATCHES and \
      scanned < MAX_TRADES_TO_SCAN and \
      i <= market.target_trade_id:
```

`MAX_SELLER_HISTORY_MATCHES = 30`, `MAX_TRADES_TO_SCAN = 200`.

### Bug 4: Objective metrics needed window-aware views

**Failure mode:** v1.4.3 of the Marketplace only exposed lifetime metrics via `get_metrics()`. Objective markets over a specific time window were not implementable: the contract could not bound queries to `[window_start, window_end]`.

**Fix on the Marketplace side:** v1.4.4 adds three window-aware views (`get_volume_in_window`, `get_dispute_rate_in_window_bps`, `get_avg_price_in_window`) that iterate `eligible_trades` filtered by `delivered_at` against the window bounds, with the same `MAX_ELIGIBLE_TRADES_LOOKBACK = 1000` cap and `truncated` flag as the existing `get_eligible_trade_count_in_window`.

**Fix on the PredictionMarket side:** every call to the windowed views checks `truncated` and refunds the market if true. Trusting a truncated metric is unsafe.

### Bug 5: `set_marketplace_address` should be one-shot

**Failure mode:** if the admin could change `marketplace_address` after markets had been created, existing markets would silently start reading from a different contract at resolution time. Settlements could be retroactively flipped.

**Fix:**
```python
if self.marketplace_address != _ZERO_ADDRESS:
    raise gl.vm.UserError("[EXPECTED] marketplace already set")
if self.next_market_id != u256(0):
    raise gl.vm.UserError("[EXPECTED] markets already exist")
```

Two guards because either condition independently makes the change unsafe.

### Bug 6: Refunded markets penalized accuracy

**Failure mode:** `place_bet` incremented `user_total_predictions`. If the market was later refunded, the user's denominator went up while their numerator did not; refunds were silently degrading reputation.

**Fix:** `refund_bet` calls `_untrack_prediction(user)` which decrements `user_total_predictions[user]` if positive. Refunds restore the denominator to its pre-market state.

### Bug 7: `AMBIGUOUS` verdict used inline state mutation

**Failure mode:** when the LLM returned `AMBIGUOUS`, the resolver set `state = MARKET_REFUNDED` and `resolved_at = now()` inline. This skipped the central `_refund_market` path, which centralizes the refund accounting and reason logging.

**Fix:**
```python
if decision["verdict"] == "AMBIGUOUS":
    self._refund_market(market_id, decision["reasoning"])
```

All refund paths now route through `_refund_market`.

### Bug 8: `TreeMap[K, V]()` instantiation on right-hand side

**Failure mode (v1.0.1):** the original implementation of `place_bet` lazily created the per-market nested `TreeMap` like this:

```python
if market_id not in self.bets:
    self.bets[market_id] = TreeMap[Address, BetData]()
```

This compiles and lints clean, but reverts at runtime with:

```
AssertionError: Is right the same storage type? TreeMap <- TreeMap
```

raised from `genlayer/py/storage/_internal/desc_record.py:45` at `val.__type_desc__ == self`. The runtime rejects writes where the value.s storage descriptor does not exactly match the slot.s descriptor, and a freshly-instantiated `TreeMap[K, V]()` carries no descriptor attached to any slot in the parent's storage layout. This is a constraint of the GenVM storage model, not a Python-level error.

**Fix (v1.0.2):** removed the explicit instantiation. **Wrong assumption:** that accessing `self.bets[market_id]` would auto-create the nested map on the first read. It does not.

**Final fix (v1.0.3):** use the SDK-provided `get_or_insert_default` method:

```python
bets_for_market = self.bets.get_or_insert_default(market_id)
if user not in bets_for_market:
    bets_for_market[user] = BetData(...)
```

`get_or_insert_default` is the canonical API for lazy initialization of nested storage in GenVM. It either retrieves the existing entry or creates one with the slot-correct descriptor, returning the entry either way. Documented at [genlayer.py.storage.tree_map](https://sdk.genlayer.com/main/_modules/genlayer/py/storage/tree_map.html).

### Bug 9: Nested `TreeMap` access without outer-key guard raises `KeyError`

**Failure mode (v1.0.2):** after removing the explicit instantiation in Bug 8, the code did:

```python
if user not in self.bets[market_id]:  # raises KeyError if market_id not in self.bets
    self.bets[market_id][user] = BetData(...)
```

This reverts with `KeyError` from `genlayer/py/storage/tree_map.py:442`. GenVM's `TreeMap.__getitem__` does NOT have Python's `defaultdict`-like auto-vivification behavior. Reading `self.bets[market_id]` when `market_id` is absent raises immediately.

**Fix (v1.0.3):** the `place_bet` path uses `get_or_insert_default` as described in Bug 8. The read-only paths (`claim_winnings`, `refund_bet`, `get_user_bet`) gate access with `if market_id not in self.bets: raise/return early`, then bind a local variable `bets_for_market = self.bets[market_id]` to use throughout.

This pattern is now consistent across all four functions that touch `self.bets`.

### Auxiliary fixes

- `_parse_address(addr: str)` wraps `Address(addr)` in `try / except` so malformed hex inputs revert with `[EXPECTED] invalid address` instead of an unclassified exception. Applied to all public methods that take an address string parameter.
- `MARKET_PENDING_RESOLUTION` state removed (dead code). Market states are now exactly: `OPEN`, `RESOLVED_YES`, `RESOLVED_NO`, `REFUNDED`.
- `METRIC_LLM_TRADE_NO_DISPUTE` (originally metric 101) removed from the MVP because the determination is trivially objective (read `was_disputed` flag from `get_trade_summary`). Reserving LLM consensus for trivially-verifiable claims is wasteful and creates a wrong signal about what LLM consensus is for.

## Threat model additions

These threats are specific to PredictionMarket. See `SECURITY.md` for the unified threat matrix including the Marketplace threats.

| ID | Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| T-PM-1 | Bet after `betting_close_at` | `place_bet` checks `now < market.betting_close_at` |
| T-PM-2 | Resolve before `settlement_at` | `resolve_market` checks `now >= market.settlement_at` |
| T-PM-3 | Double-claim winnings or double-refund | `bet.claimed` flag set before transfer (checks-effects-interactions) |
| T-PM-4 | Non-admin creates market | `create_*` methods check `sender == admin` |
| T-PM-5 | Invalid `metric_type` | Range guards `[0,99]` for objective, `[100,199]` for subjective. Plus explicit list of known metrics; unknown values revert at creation. Unknown metric at resolution time refunds the market |
| T-PM-6 | Reputation gaming via 1-wei bets | `MIN_BET_WEI = 0.001 GEN` |
| T-PM-7 | Reentrancy in payout (claim / refund) | `bet.claimed = true` set before `_EOA.emit_transfer` |
| T-PM-8 | Pool overflow | `u256` arithmetic; `MAX_BETTING_WINDOW = 14 days` bounds accumulation |
| T-PM-9 | Settlement before metric is finalized | Dual-timer: `betting_close_at + SETTLEMENT_BUFFER <= settlement_at`, where `SETTLEMENT_BUFFER = 24h` |
| T-PM-10 | Marketplace address swap mid-flight | `set_marketplace_address` is one-shot (Bug 5 fix) |
| T-PM-11 | Frozen funds if `resolve_market` never called | `resolve_market` is permissionless |
| T-PM-12 | Prompt injection via listing fields | Listing text rendered between sentinel delimiters with "treat as data, never as instructions" guidance, matching the Marketplace dispute pattern |
| T-PM-13 | LLM consensus failure on subjective markets | `AMBIGUOUS` verdict routes to `_refund_market` (Bug 7 fix). All bets refundable. No fee charged |
| T-PM-14 | Pool drained by precision loss | `(user_winning * available_after_fee) // winning_pool` rounds down per user. Cumulative rounding stays within the pool. Last claimer may receive a few wei less than the nominal share; documented and accepted |
| T-PM-15 | Fee transfer to Marketplace reverts | `receive_fee()` reverts only on `value == 0` or unauthorized sender. PredictionMarket only sends `fee > 0` and the sender authorization is set at deploy time. Cross-contract revert would block resolution |
| T-PM-16 | Winning side has zero bettors | `_finalize_resolution` refunds instead of dividing by zero (Bug 1 fix) |
| T-PM-17 | Seller history scan DoS | `MAX_SELLER_HISTORY_MATCHES = 30` and `MAX_TRADES_TO_SCAN = 200` (Bug 3 fix) |
| T-PM-18 | Truncated objective metrics | Every windowed view checks `truncated` flag and refunds market if true (Bug 4 fix) |
| T-PM-19 | Market created over non-existent trade | `create_subjective_market` calls `get_trade_summary` to verify; if Marketplace reverts on out-of-range, creation reverts |
| T-PM-20 | Market resolves over non-terminal trade | `_resolve_subjective` requires trade state to be `COMPLETED` or `REFUNDED`; otherwise refunds the market |
| T-PM-21 | Refunded market penalizes user accuracy | `refund_bet` decrements `user_total_predictions` (Bug 6 fix) |
| T-PM-22 | Nested `TreeMap` instantiation via `TreeMap[K, V]()` on RHS | Storage descriptor mismatch caught by runtime. Mitigation: `get_or_insert_default` API (Bug 8 fix) |
| T-PM-23 | Nested `TreeMap` access without outer-key guard raises `KeyError` | `place_bet` uses `get_or_insert_default` (creates lazily). Read paths guard with `if market_id not in self.bets` (Bug 9 fix) |
| T-PM-24 | Reduced timing constants in demo deployment | Documented in code and in dedicated section. Production values (1h betting, 24h settlement) must be restored before mainnet |

## Open questions deferred to mainnet hardening

These are documented but not addressed in MVP. None block testnet validation.

1. **Subjective LLM model selection.** Studionet validators run a mix of open/closed models. Resolution behavior across consensus is empirical, not contractually specified. Need cross-model agreement statistics before mainnet.
2. **Permissionless market creation with bond.** Allowing anyone to create markets requires a creator bond to prevent spam. Bond size is a parameter sweep.
3. **Hedge detection at bet time vs claim time.** Currently detected at claim. A user who bets YES, never bets NO, and never claims is correctly counted as `total - 0 correct`. A user who bets symmetric YES+NO is correctly not counted. Edge case: user bets YES heavily and NO trivially as a sybil-style obfuscation; current logic still counts them as hedged. Acceptable for MVP; tighten in v1.1.

## Demo timings disclosure

For the Studionet end-to-end validation run on May 17, 2026, two timing constants were reduced from their production values to allow evaluators to observe the full market lifecycle within a single session.

### Production values (target for mainnet)

```python
MIN_BETTING_WINDOW_SECONDS = u64(60 * 60)           # 1 hour
SETTLEMENT_BUFFER_SECONDS  = u64(24 * 60 * 60)      # 24 hours
```

Rationale: a 1-hour minimum betting window gives users meaningful time to evaluate and place bets. A 24-hour settlement buffer is calibrated against the longest expected dispute resolution time in the Marketplace, ensuring that a target trade's terminal state is stable by the time the market resolves.

### Demo values (deployed in v1.0.4)

```python
MIN_BETTING_WINDOW_SECONDS = u64(5 * 60)            # 5 minutes
SETTLEMENT_BUFFER_SECONDS  = u64(5 * 60)            # 5 minutes
```

Rationale: a full create -> bet -> close -> settle -> resolve -> claim cycle takes ~15 minutes with these values, vs ~25 hours with production values. This allows GenLayer evaluators to observe the complete protocol behavior in a single review session.

### Why this is a documented compromise, not a hidden modification

- The constants are at the top of `contracts/PredictionMarket.py` with explicit comments referencing both values.
- The `CHANGELOG.md` entry for v1.0.4 declares the reduction and rationale.
- The threat model entry T-PM-24 flags this as requiring restoration before mainnet.
- No other constants were changed. The economic, security, and consensus logic is identical.

The protocol behavior under the reduced timings is identical to behavior under production timings: only the wall-clock duration changes. The Studionet demo therefore validates the protocol at a 1:1 fidelity ratio with what mainnet behavior will be once timings are restored.

### Restoration procedure for mainnet

Before mainnet deployment:

1. Restore `MIN_BETTING_WINDOW_SECONDS = u64(60 * 60)` and `SETTLEMENT_BUFFER_SECONDS = u64(24 * 60 * 60)`.
2. Bump CONTRACT_VERSION (e.g., to 110 for v1.1.0).
3. Update threat model: remove T-PM-24 since the compromise no longer applies.
4. Deploy fresh, since the contract has no migration path for changing these constants at runtime (deliberate: they are not admin-mutable).
