# Poinmarket

A trust-minimized P2P marketplace with an integrated meta-prediction market, built on [GenLayer](https://genlayer.com) Intelligent Contracts.

> **Status:** MVP. Deployed on Studionet. Not audited. Not for production funds.

## What this is

Two contracts that share one substrate:

**1. Escrow-backed P2P marketplace.** Buyers and sellers transact physical goods peer-to-peer. Payment is locked in the contract until delivery is confirmed. When disputes occur, an AI-validator quorum reads both parties' evidence and adjudicates. No human arbiter, no centralized appeals.

**2. Meta-prediction market over marketplace activity.** Binary prediction markets resolve against on-chain Marketplace state. Two categories of markets are supported:

- **Objective markets:** resolve numerically by reading windowed metrics from the Marketplace (trade count, volume, dispute rate, average price). No LLM involved.
- **Subjective markets:** resolve via LLM consensus evaluating a specific trade's outcome (was the description honest? is the seller trustworthy based on history?).

The two contracts compound: the marketplace generates the verifiable data substrate, and the prediction market gives the marketplace a second usage primitive. 1% of each market's pool is forwarded to the marketplace as fee, creating revenue coupling between the two products.

## Why GenLayer

This design is intractable on EVM and tractable on GenLayer for one specific reason: **both dispute resolution and subjective market resolution require natural-language judgment.** Solidity cannot make those calls without an external oracle or human arbiter, and both centralize the trust model.

GenLayer's [Optimistic Democracy](https://docs.genlayer.com/understand-genlayer-protocol/core-concepts/optimistic-democracy) makes the validator quorum itself the arbiter. The AI consensus replaces the centralized resolution layer that every existing P2P escrow ([Kleros](https://kleros.io), [Binance P2P](https://p2p.binance.com)) requires. The same primitive resolves prediction markets over subjective claims that Polymarket and Augur cannot host.

## Architecture

```
Marketplace.py (singleton, v1.4.4)
  - All trades stored in TreeMap[u256, TradeData]
  - LLM-arbitrated dispute resolution via gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe
  - Window-aware metric views for prediction market queries
  - receive_fee() accepts cross-contract value from authorized PredictionMarket
       |
       | view + emit_transfer(value).receive_fee()
       |
PredictionMarket.py (singleton, v1.0.4)
  - All markets stored in TreeMap[u256, MarketData]
  - Reads Marketplace state at fixed address (set once, immutable)
  - Resolves objective markets locally via Marketplace views
  - Resolves subjective markets via LLM consensus
  - Forwards 1% of pool to Marketplace as fee on resolution
```

Both contracts are singletons (one deployment serves all trades / all markets), indexed by sequential IDs. The choice of singleton over factory is documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Deployed contracts

**Studionet (Chain ID 61999):**

| Contract | Address | Version |
|---|---|---|
| Marketplace | `0x29f58D5ACC8b85250D3Dae2692DEADED346c6e67` | 1.4.4 |
| PredictionMarket | `0x2b0B5f76Db290D77DF53250B7f0540fc2D8cb48E` | 1.0.4 |

Both contracts are wired:
- `Marketplace.authorized_fee_sender` points at the PredictionMarket.
- `PredictionMarket.marketplace_address` points at the Marketplace (one-shot, immutable).

Source code in this repository matches the deployed bytecode. Version constants are verifiable on-chain via each contract's `get_contract_info()` view.

## Live demo

A full end-to-end run was executed on Studionet on May 17, 2026. The on-chain evidence covers:

- One Marketplace trade (Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones, 1 GEN) created, paid, shipped, delivered (happy path with 0.98 GEN to seller and 0.02 GEN to fees).
- Two subjective PredictionMarket markets over that trade, both targeting metric `METRIC_LLM_TRADE_DESCRIPTION_HONEST`.
- Five-validator LLM consensus resolving both markets to YES, with independently produced reasoning strings.
- 0.03 GEN of total fees forwarded cross-contract from PredictionMarket to Marketplace via `receive_fee`.
- A losing-side claim attempt that correctly reverted, with all five validators agreeing on the protocol-level revert.

Full transaction-level evidence, validator quorums, LLM reasoning, threat model coverage matrix, and honest disclosure of paths NOT exercised: see [`docs/DEMO_RESULTS.md`](./docs/DEMO_RESULTS.md).

The demo deployment uses reduced timing constants (5 minutes instead of 1 hour / 24 hours) so that evaluators can observe the full market lifecycle in a single session. The compromise is transparent and documented; production values must be restored before mainnet. See the "Demo timings disclosure" section of `docs/PREDICTION_MARKET_DESIGN.md`.

- **What are the security guarantees?** -> `docs/SECURITY.md`
- **What's been validated on-chain?** -> `docs/DEMO_RESULTS.md`
- **How do I run this locally?** -> `docs/SETUP.md`
- **What's the version history?** -> `CHANGELOG.md`

## Status and roadmap

**Done:**

- Marketplace v1.4.4 deployed, happy path and dispute paths exercised.
- PredictionMarket v1.0.4 deployed, subjective markets resolved end-to-end.
- Cross-contract integration validated (read + value-transfer write).
- Threat model with 37 documented threats and mitigations.

**Pending:**

- Restore production timing constants in PredictionMarket v1.1.0 before mainnet.
- Run an objective market end-to-end (the path is implemented, not exercised).
- Run a `METRIC_LLM_SELLER_TRUSTWORTHY` market with multi-trade seller history.
- Independent security review.
- Permissionless market creation with creator bond.
- Frontend.

**Out of scope for MVP** (deferred to future work):

- AMM-style pricing (LMSR, CPMM). MVP uses parimutuel pool-share pricing.
- Multi-outcome markets. MVP is binary YES/NO only.
- Off-chain claim markets. MVP markets are always over Marketplace state.
- Fiat settlement layer. See `docs/FUTURE_FIAT_ESCROW.md`.
